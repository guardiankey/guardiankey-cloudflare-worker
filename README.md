# GuardianKey for Cloudflare (worker)

This is a Cloudflare worker to integrate with GuardianKey.

GuardianKey is a solution to protect systems against authentication attacks. It uses Artificial Intelligence to detect if access attempts are from legitimate users. Attackers can be blocked even using the right password. GuardianKey provides an attack risk in real-time based on the userâ€™s behavior, threat intelligence, and psychometrics (or behavioral biometrics). You can notify your users, block or log the attempts.

## How to find information to configure the worker



## How the worker works?

- The worker intercepts all POSTs to your site that have the variable "username_field" posted. 
- This is used to create an event and send it to the GuardianKey engine.
- GuardianKey processes, saves, and replies a ACCEPT/BLOCK information.
- If blocked, the worker invokes the URL "logout_url".
- Events can be seen in the GuardianKey administration panel.
